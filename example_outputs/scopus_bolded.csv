An environmentally and resource friendly development of food security is required at international and national levels. Digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to address these challenges and facilitate the transformation of agriculture and the food value chain. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to identify widely applicable measures to support digitalisation in order to promote the transformation towards sustainable agri-food systems. METHODS: A foresight process was conducted in the case study region of Lower Austria. The process consisted of seven steps and included data collection through desk research, internal project discussions and two workshops with regional stakeholders. Scenarios were co-created with stakeholders from different sectors, including industry, policy and research. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Five scenarios were developed: “Trend towards flexibility”, “D4COOP”, “Specialisation”, “Agricultural industry” and “GIIRA (great-innovative-intensive-reactive-adaptive)”. Challenges related to the digital transformation of agriculture and corresponding measures to address these challenges were identified. The measures were summarized in the following thematic areas: (a) Technology, Research & Innovation, (b) Market & Business Models, (c) Financial Support, (d) Culture & Social Values, (e) Networks, (f) Competencies & Knowledge, (g) Infrastructure, and (h) Policy Framework. SIGNIFICANCE: This research contributes to the identification of probable future developments and to the elaboration of widely applicable measures by using foresight methods, which can be implemented with the respective stakeholders in the case study region of Lower Austria. Utilizing the scenario technique helps to facilitate dialogue and identify future options for action and measures fostering innovation and research in addressing emerging challenges at the regional level.

A key intervention proposed to reduce the footprint of oil palm is intensifying production to free up spare land for nature, yet the indirect land-use implications of intensification through market forces are poorly understood. We used a spatially explicit land-rent modeling framework to characterize the supply and demand of oil palm in Indonesia under multiple yield improvement and demand elasticity scenarios and explored how shifts in market equilibria alter projections of crop expansion. Oil palm supply was sensitive to crop prices and yield improvements. Across all our scenarios, intensification raised agricultural rents and lowered the effectiveness of reductions in crop expansion. Increased yields lowered oil palm prices, but these price-drops were not sufficient to prevent further cropland expansion from increased agricultural rents under a range of price elasticities of demand. Crucially, we found that agricultural intensification might only result in land being spared when the demand relationship was highly inelastic and crop prices were very low (i.e., a 70% price reduction). Under this scenario, the extent of land spared (∼0.32 million ha) was countered by the continued establishment of new plantations (∼1.04 million ha).

In this study, over the course of four growing seasons (2018 to 2021), we surveyed dry bean fields in Alberta and collected daily in-field weather data and daily in-field ascospore counts.

Kashkavals, made of cow or sheep milk since olden times, pertain to this food category. Kashkavals are a type of semi-hard yellow cheese originally from Balkan countries, such as Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Kosovo, and Serbia, marked by various aromas, tastes, textures, flavors, and shapes depending on their geographical area. Kashkaval cheese producers are increasingly more interested in finding solutions from the dairy industry to prolong the shelf durability of the product, to improve its flavor and taste characteristics, while reducing the risks impeding product quality due to various types of bacteria and molds. A possible solution to reduce risks is to include essential oils in the milk used to produce Kashkaval cheese. If manufacturing such cheese does not involve significant technological challenges, a producer must identify clients' willingness to choose and purchase a product like Kashkaval cheese with a natural thyme flavor from essential oil. The aim of the research is to study the consumers' purchase intention towards Kashkaval cheese, by relying on the Stimulus-Organism Response model (SOR). Therefore, the authors develop a conceptual model based on the literature. The relations of the conceptual model are then empirically tested among 458 respondents from an emerging market. The conceptual model considers the price, as well as the utilitarian, hedonic, and authentic attributes of the Kashkaval cheese as stimuli, while the uniqueness and image are considered mental processes exerted by the organism. Finally, the impact of stimuli and the organism in generating consumer purchase intention (response) is further analyzed. Data are collected through a quantitative-based survey and later analyzed by using structural equation modeling with SmartPLS. The findings suggest that the purchase intention of Kashkaval cheese depends mainly on its image among consumers and its uniqueness. At the same time, its hedonic and utilitarian characteristics along with price and local/regional character of the thyme-flavored kashkaval decisively determine customer preference. © 2024","Consumers' behavior; Kashkaval cheese; Purchase intention; Stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model; Thyme essential oil","Consumer behavior; Dairy products; Essential oils; Sales; Textures; Conceptual model; Consumer purchase; Cows' milk; Kashkaval cheese; Product offerings; Purchase intention; Response model; Romanians; Stimulus-organism-response  model; Thyme essential oil; Purchasing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200241330",6,"Enhancing Romanian consumers' purchase intention of a new Kashkaval cheese with <b style=""color:#FFA500;"">natural</b> thyme flavor","The modern consumer increasingly prefers those products offering utility that are also healthy, safe, pleasant, and at a convenient price.
