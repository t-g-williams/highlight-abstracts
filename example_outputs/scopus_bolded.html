An environmentally and resource friendly development of <b style="color:#006400;">food</b> security is required at international and national levels. Digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to address these challenges and facilitate the transformation of <b style="color:#006400;">agriculture</b> and the <b style="color:#006400;">food</b> value chain. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to identify widely applicable measures to support digitalisation in order to promote the transformation towards sustainable <b style="color:#006400;">agri</b>-<b style="color:#006400;">food</b> systems. METHODS: A foresight process was conducted in the case study region of Lower Austria. The process consisted of seven steps and included data collection through desk research, internal project discussions and two workshops with regional stakeholders. Scenarios were co-created with stakeholders from different sectors, including industry, policy and research. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Five scenarios were developed: “Trend towards flexibility”, “D4COOP”, “Specialisation”, “<b style="color:#006400;">Agricultural</b> industry” and “GIIRA (great-innovative-intensive-reactive-adaptive)”. Challenges related to the digital transformation of <b style="color:#006400;">agriculture</b> and corresponding measures to address these challenges were identified. The measures were summarized in the following thematic areas: (a) Technology, Research & Innovation, (b) <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">Market</b> & Business <b style="color:#0000FF;">Models</b>, (c) Financial Support, (d) Culture & Social Values, (e) Networks, (f) Competencies & Knowledge, (g) Infrastructure, and (h) Policy Framework. SIGNIFICANCE: This research contributes to the identification of probable future developments and to the elaboration of widely applicable measures by using foresight methods, which can be implemented with the respective stakeholders in the case study region of Lower Austria. Utilizing the scenario technique helps to facilitate dialogue and identify future options for action and measures fostering innovation and research in addressing emerging challenges at the regional level. The findings provide insights for tackling the challenges of complex <b style="color:#006400;">agri</b>-<b style="color:#006400;">food</b> systems in deciding which issues to prioritize for transformation, encompassing policy, finance, education, and digital skills, with digitalisation as leverage point and sustainability as a key concern. </p>

The objective is to provide a scientific basis for policy interventions. Subject and methods: This study utilizes a multi-country, multi-sector <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">CGE</b>-COVID-19 <b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> to analyze the repercussions of the pandemic in 2022. The re-search focuses on quantifying the effects of COVID-19 on the macroeconomy and various industry sectors within six economies: the United States, China, the EU, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic shock had the most significant impact on China and the EU, followed by notable effects observed in the United States and the United Kingdom. In contrast, South Korea and Japan experienced relatively minimal effects. The reduction in output caused by the pandemic has affected major economies in multiple sectors, including real industries such as <b style="color:#006400;">forestry</b> and fisheries, and the services such as hotels and restaurants. Conclusion: The overall negative macroeconomic impact of the epidemic on major economies has been significant. Strategic interventions encompassing initiatives like augmenting capital supply, diminishing corporate taxes and fees, offering individual subsidies, and nurturing international cooperation held the potential to mitigate the detrimental economic consequences and enhance the global-economic amid the pan-demic. Consequently, this study contributes to the advancement of global anti-epidemic policies targeting economic recovery.

A key intervention proposed to reduce the footprint of oil palm is intensifying production to free up spare <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> for nature, yet the indirect <b style="color:#006400;">land</b>-use implications of intensification through <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">market</b> forces are poorly understood. We used a spatially explicit <b style="color:#006400;">land</b>-rent <b style="color:#0000FF;">modeling</b> framework to characterize the supply and demand of oil palm in Indonesia under multiple yield improvement and demand elasticity scenarios and explored how shifts in <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">market</b> equilibria alter projections of crop expansion. Oil palm supply was sensitive to crop prices and yield improvements. Across all our scenarios, intensification raised <b style="color:#006400;">agricultural</b> rents and lowered the effectiveness of reductions in crop expansion. Increased yields lowered oil palm prices, but these price-drops were not sufficient to prevent further cropland expansion from increased <b style="color:#006400;">agricultural</b> rents under a range of price elasticities of demand. Crucially, we found that <b style="color:#006400;">agricultural</b> intensification might only result in <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> being spared when the demand relationship was highly inelastic and crop prices were very low (i.e., a 70% price reduction). Under this scenario, the extent of <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> spared (∼0.32 million ha) was countered by the continued establishment of new plantations (∼1.04 million ha). Oil palm intensification in Indonesia could exacerbate current pressures on its imperiled <b style="color:#FFA500;">biodiversity</b> and should be deployed with stronger spatial planning and enforcement to prevent further cropland expansion. </p>

However, there are growing debates on how to best pursue these targets. Proposed transformation strategies include <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">market</b>- and technology-driven green-growth, shifting towards a sufficiency-oriented post-growth economy, and a transformation driven primarily by strong government action. Here we quantify three alternative sustainable development pathways (SDPs), Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons, that reflect these different societal strategies. We compare the quantifications from two <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">integrated assessment</b> <b style="color:#0000FF;">models</b> and two sectoral <b style="color:#0000FF;">models</b> of the buildings and materials sectors across a broad set of indicators for sustainable development and climate action. Our global multi-scenario and multi-<b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> analysis shows that all three SDPs enable substantial progress towards the human development goals of the SDGs. They simultaneously limit global warming and prevent further environmental degradation, with the sufficiency-oriented Resilient Communities scenario showing the lowest peak warming and lowest reliance on carbon dioxide removal as well as the largest improvements in <b style="color:#FFA500;">biodiversity</b> intactness. The SDPs also alleviate the concerns about the biogeophysical and technological feasibility of narrowly-focused climate change mitigation scenarios. However, the shifts in energy and <b style="color:#006400;">food</b> consumption patterns assumed in the SDPs, ranging from moderate in Economy-driven Innovation to very ambitious in Resilient Communities, also lead to increased challenges regarding socio-cultural feasibility. </p>

Despite widespread consensus on the need for transformation, discussed strategies vary widely, from technology-driven to sufficiency-focused approaches, emphasizing different agents of change and policy mixes. This study assesses the implications of a new generation of target-seeking scenarios incorporating such diverse sustainability perspectives. We apply two <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">integrated assessment</b> <b style="color:#0000FF;">models</b> to explore <b style="color:#006400;">food</b> and <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> futures under three whole-economy sustainable development pathways (SDPs): Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons.

While all SDPs comply with the Paris climate target, they diverge in the timing of climate mitigation efforts and focus on different greenhouse gases and emission sources. The Economy-driven Innovation pathway rapidly achieves net-negative CO2 emissions from the <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> system, whereas the pathways Resilient Communities and Managing the Global Commons significantly decrease <b style="color:#006400;">agricultural</b> non-CO2 emissions.

To navigate the potentially competing <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> use demands of these goals, we develop a spatially explicit <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">partial equilibrium</b> <b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> that analyzes the implementation of these targets both independently and concurrently at the EU and national levels. Results indicate that the 25% organic <b style="color:#006400;">farming</b> target is the restricting constraint with high marginal costs, leading to less cropland use, higher <b style="color:#006400;">land</b> prices, and higher <b style="color:#006400;">farming</b> revenues. Consumers would see an increase in average commodity prices of up to 50%. Policy instruments could counteract these effects to ensure the acceptance and increased demand for organic products and reduce environmental leakage to the rest of the world. Less than 1% of cropland area in the EU is needed to fulfill the strict protection target. Hence, the co-fulfillment of both targets incurs minimal <b style="color:#006400;">land</b>-use conflicts. Half of the newly strictly protected areas are re-designations of already protected areas. Thus, a comprehensive approach that combines expansion with proper management is crucial to achieving conservation goals. This study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that balances <b style="color:#FFA500;">biodiversity</b> conservation and <b style="color:#006400;">agricultural</b> sustainability and shows that seemingly contradictory goals can be pursued simultaneously with planning and supporting policies. </p>

Kashkavals, made of cow or sheep milk since olden times, pertain to this <b style="color:#006400;">food</b> category. Kashkavals are a type of semi-hard yellow cheese originally from Balkan countries, such as Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Kosovo, and Serbia, marked by various aromas, tastes, textures, flavors, and shapes depending on their geographical area. Kashkaval cheese producers are increasingly more interested in finding solutions from the dairy industry to prolong the shelf durability of the product, to improve its flavor and taste characteristics, while reducing the risks impeding product quality due to various types of bacteria and molds. A possible solution to reduce risks is to include essential oils in the milk used to produce Kashkaval cheese. If manufacturing such cheese does not involve significant technological challenges, a producer must identify clients' willingness to choose and purchase a product like Kashkaval cheese with a <b style="color:#FFA500;">natural</b> thyme flavor from essential oil. The aim of the research is to study the consumers' purchase intention towards Kashkaval cheese, by relying on the Stimulus-<b style="color:#FFA500;">Organism</b> Response <b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> (SOR). Therefore, the authors develop a conceptual <b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> based on the literature. The relations of the conceptual <b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> are then empirically tested among 458 respondents from an emerging <b style="color:#ADD8E6;">market</b>. The conceptual <b style="color:#0000FF;">model</b> considers the price, as well as the utilitarian, hedonic, and authentic attributes of the Kashkaval cheese as stimuli, while the uniqueness and image are considered mental processes exerted by the <b style="color:#FFA500;">organism</b>. Finally, the impact of stimuli and the <b style="color:#FFA500;">organism</b> in generating consumer purchase intention (response) is further analyzed. Data are collected through a quantitative-based survey and later analyzed by using structural equation <b style="color:#0000FF;">modeling</b> with SmartPLS. The findings suggest that the purchase intention of Kashkaval cheese depends mainly on its image among consumers and its uniqueness. At the same time, its hedonic and utilitarian characteristics along with price and local/regional character of the thyme-flavored kashkaval decisively determine customer preference. </p>
