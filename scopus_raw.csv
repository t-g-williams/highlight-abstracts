However, there are growing debates on how to best pursue these targets. Proposed transformation strategies include market- and technology-driven green-growth, shifting towards a sufficiency-oriented post-growth economy, and a transformation driven primarily by strong government action. Here we quantify three alternative sustainable development pathways (SDPs), Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons, that reflect these different societal strategies. We compare the quantifications from two integrated assessment models and two sectoral models of the buildings and materials sectors across a broad set of indicators for sustainable development and climate action. Our global multi-scenario and multi-model analysis shows that all three SDPs enable substantial progress towards the human development goals of the SDGs. They simultaneously limit global warming and prevent further environmental degradation, with the sufficiency-oriented Resilient Communities scenario showing the lowest peak warming and lowest reliance on carbon dioxide removal as well as the largest improvements in biodiversity intactness. The SDPs also alleviate the concerns about the biogeophysical and technological feasibility of narrowly-focused climate change mitigation scenarios. However, the shifts in energy and food consumption patterns assumed in the SDPs, ranging from moderate in Economy-driven Innovation to very ambitious in Resilient Communities, also lead to increased challenges regarding socio-cultural feasibility. © 2024 The Author(s).

Despite widespread consensus on the need for transformation, discussed strategies vary widely, from technology-driven to sufficiency-focused approaches, emphasizing different agents of change and policy mixes. This study assesses the implications of a new generation of target-seeking scenarios incorporating such diverse sustainability perspectives. We apply two integrated assessment models to explore food and land futures under three whole-economy sustainable development pathways (SDPs): Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons. Our assessment shows that the SDPs align sufficient food supply with progress towards planetary integrity, halting biodiversity loss, mitigating adverse impacts from irrigation, and significantly reducing nitrogen pollution. While all SDPs comply with the Paris climate target, they diverge in the timing of climate mitigation efforts and focus on different greenhouse gases and emission sources. The Economy-driven Innovation pathway rapidly achieves net-negative CO2 emissions from the land system, whereas the pathways Resilient Communities and Managing the Global Commons significantly decrease agricultural non-CO2 emissions. Moreover, sustainability interventions attenuate trade-offs associated with narrowly focused mitigation scenarios and reduce reliance on carbon dioxide removal strategies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. © 2024 The Author(s).

Disease forecasting is one tool that could help growers manage the disease while reducing fungicide use. However, predicting white mold epidemics has remained difficult due to their sporadic occurrence. In this study, over the course of four growing seasons (2018 to 2021), we surveyed dry bean fields in Alberta and collected daily in-field weather data and daily in-field ascospore counts. White mold levels were variable and generally high in all years, confirming that the disease is ubiquitous and a constant threat to dry bean production. Ascospores were present throughout the growing season, and mean ascospore levels varied by field, month, and year. Models based on in-field weather and ascospore levels were not highly predictive of final disease incidence in a field, suggesting that environment and pathogen presence were not limiting factors to disease development. Rather, significant effects of market class on disease were found, with pinto beans, on average, having the highest disease incidence (33%) followed by great northern (15%), black (10%), red (6%), and yellow (5%). When incidence of these market classes was modeled separately, different environmental variables were important in each model; however, average wind speed was a significant variable in all models. Taken together, these findings suggest that white mold management in dry bean should focus on fungicide use, plant genetics, irrigation management, and other agronomic factors. © His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2023.",aerobiology; ascospores; disease prediction; dry bean; epidemiology; modeling; Phaseolus vulgaris; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; white mold,"Alberta; Ascomycota; Fungicides, Industrial; Phaseolus; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; Spores, Fungal; fungicide; Alberta; Ascomycetes; fungus spore; genetics; microbiology; Phaseolus; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181165054

The objective is to provide a scientific basis for policy interventions. Subject and methods: This study utilizes a multi-country, multi-sector CGE-COVID-19 model to analyze the repercussions of the pandemic in 2022. The re-search focuses on quantifying the effects of COVID-19 on the macroeconomy and various industry sectors within six economies: the United States, China, the EU, the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic shock had the most significant impact on China and the EU, followed by notable effects observed in the United States and the United Kingdom. In contrast, South Korea and Japan experienced relatively minimal effects. The reduction in output caused by the pandemic has affected major economies in multiple sectors, including real industries such as forestry and fisheries, and the services such as hotels and restaurants. Conclusion: The overall negative macroeconomic impact of the epidemic on major economies has been significant. Strategic interventions encompassing initiatives like augmenting capital supply, diminishing corporate taxes and fees, offering individual subsidies, and nurturing international cooperation held the potential to mitigate the detrimental economic consequences and enhance the global-economic amid the pan-demic. Consequently, this study contributes to the advancement of global anti-epidemic policies targeting economic recovery. Moreover, using the CGE-COVID-19 model has enriched the exploration of general equilibrium models in PHEIC events.

To navigate the potentially competing land use demands of these goals, we develop a spatially explicit partial equilibrium model that analyzes the implementation of these targets both independently and concurrently at the EU and national levels. Results indicate that the 25% organic farming target is the restricting constraint with high marginal costs, leading to less cropland use, higher land prices, and higher farming revenues. Consumers would see an increase in average commodity prices of up to 50%. Policy instruments could counteract these effects to ensure the acceptance and increased demand for organic products and reduce environmental leakage to the rest of the world. Less than 1% of cropland area in the EU is needed to fulfill the strict protection target. Hence, the co-fulfillment of both targets incurs minimal land-use conflicts. Half of the newly strictly protected areas are re-designations of already protected areas. Thus, a comprehensive approach that combines expansion with proper management is crucial to achieving conservation goals. This study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that balances biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability and shows that seemingly contradictory goals can be pursued simultaneously with planning and supporting policies. © 2025 The Author(s).

Kashkavals, made of cow or sheep milk since olden times, pertain to this food category. Kashkavals are a type of semi-hard yellow cheese originally from Balkan countries, such as Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Kosovo, and Serbia, marked by various aromas, tastes, textures, flavors, and shapes depending on their geographical area. Kashkaval cheese producers are increasingly more interested in finding solutions from the dairy industry to prolong the shelf durability of the product, to improve its flavor and taste characteristics, while reducing the risks impeding product quality due to various types of bacteria and molds. A possible solution to reduce risks is to include essential oils in the milk used to produce Kashkaval cheese. If manufacturing such cheese does not involve significant technological challenges, a producer must identify clients' willingness to choose and purchase a product like Kashkaval cheese with a natural thyme flavor from essential oil. The aim of the research is to study the consumers' purchase intention towards Kashkaval cheese, by relying on the Stimulus-Organism Response model (SOR). Therefore, the authors develop a conceptual model based on the literature. The relations of the conceptual model are then empirically tested among 458 respondents from an emerging market. The conceptual model considers the price, as well as the utilitarian, hedonic, and authentic attributes of the Kashkaval cheese as stimuli, while the uniqueness and image are considered mental processes exerted by the organism. Finally, the impact of stimuli and the organism in generating consumer purchase intention (response) is further analyzed. Data are collected through a quantitative-based survey and later analyzed by using structural equation modeling with SmartPLS. The findings suggest that the purchase intention of Kashkaval cheese depends mainly on its image among consumers and its uniqueness. At the same time, its hedonic and utilitarian characteristics along with price and local/regional character of the thyme-flavored kashkaval decisively determine customer preference. © 2024",Consumers' behavior; Kashkaval cheese; Purchase intention; Stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model; Thyme essential oil,Consumer behavior; Dairy products; Essential oils; Sales; Textures; Conceptual model; Consumer purchase; Cows' milk; Kashkaval cheese; Product offerings; Purchase intention; Response model; Romanians; Stimulus-organism-response  model; Thyme essential oil; Purchasing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85200241330

A key intervention proposed to reduce the footprint of oil palm is intensifying production to free up spare land for nature, yet the indirect land-use implications of intensification through market forces are poorly understood. We used a spatially explicit land-rent modeling framework to characterize the supply and demand of oil palm in Indonesia under multiple yield improvement and demand elasticity scenarios and explored how shifts in market equilibria alter projections of crop expansion. Oil palm supply was sensitive to crop prices and yield improvements. Across all our scenarios, intensification raised agricultural rents and lowered the effectiveness of reductions in crop expansion. Increased yields lowered oil palm prices, but these price-drops were not sufficient to prevent further cropland expansion from increased agricultural rents under a range of price elasticities of demand. Crucially, we found that agricultural intensification might only result in land being spared when the demand relationship was highly inelastic and crop prices were very low (i.e., a 70% price reduction). Under this scenario, the extent of land spared (∼0.32 million ha) was countered by the continued establishment of new plantations (∼1.04 million ha). Oil palm intensification in Indonesia could exacerbate current pressures on its imperiled biodiversity and should be deployed with stronger spatial planning and enforcement to prevent further cropland expansion. © 2023 The Authors.

An environmentally and resource friendly development of food security is required at international and national levels. Digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to address these challenges and facilitate the transformation of agriculture and the food value chain. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to identify widely applicable measures to support digitalisation in order to promote the transformation towards sustainable agri-food systems. METHODS: A foresight process was conducted in the case study region of Lower Austria. The process consisted of seven steps and included data collection through desk research, internal project discussions and two workshops with regional stakeholders. Scenarios were co-created with stakeholders from different sectors, including industry, policy and research. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Five scenarios were developed: “Trend towards flexibility”, “D4COOP”, “Specialisation”, “Agricultural industry” and “GIIRA (great-innovative-intensive-reactive-adaptive)”. Challenges related to the digital transformation of agriculture and corresponding measures to address these challenges were identified. The measures were summarized in the following thematic areas: (a) Technology, Research & Innovation, (b) Market & Business Models, (c) Financial Support, (d) Culture & Social Values, (e) Networks, (f) Competencies & Knowledge, (g) Infrastructure, and (h) Policy Framework. SIGNIFICANCE: This research contributes to the identification of probable future developments and to the elaboration of widely applicable measures by using foresight methods, which can be implemented with the respective stakeholders in the case study region of Lower Austria. Utilizing the scenario technique helps to facilitate dialogue and identify future options for action and measures fostering innovation and research in addressing emerging challenges at the regional level. The findings provide insights for tackling the challenges of complex agri-food systems in deciding which issues to prioritize for transformation, encompassing policy, finance, education, and digital skills, with digitalisation as leverage point and sustainability as a key concern. © 2025 The Authors",Agriculture; Co-creation; Digitalisation; Food system; Foresight; Scenarios; Small-scale farms,Austria; Lower Austria; agricultural policy; agricultural technology; alternative agriculture; digitization; food security; innovation; planning method; regional development; scenario analysis,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214036574

New allometric models have been implemented in the FIA program database based on a recent National Scale Volume and Biomass (NSVB) study for updated tree biomass and carbon estimates. Moreover, newer soil and litter carbon models with corresponding new estimates implemented in the FIA database, dependent on live tree biomass inputs. To understand effects of these updated models on forest carbon estimates, we compared estimates between previous and new (current) models. The most significant differences in total carbon (i.e., combined total carbon stock across various forest pools, including soil organic matter, litter, and live and dead tree biomass) were driven by larger estimates of soil organic carbon and smaller estimates of litter carbon. Overall, live tree merchantable volume, aboveground live biomass and carbon, and belowground live biomass estimates, were larger with the new models. Magnitude of differences varied by attribute, region, forest type, species, and tree sizes, as expected. Importantly, because previous models underestimated biomass in tops and limbs, there is now a higher estimated proportion of total tree biomass in these components and a lower proportion in the merchantable bole. We discuss some implications in the context of voluntary carbon accounting and forest carbon projects under the different registries and the potential influence of the new model system to timber market analyses and associated asset valuations. © 2025",Carbon pools; Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); Litter carbon; National Scale Volume and Biomass (NSVB); Soil organic carbon; Tree live biomass,Biomass; Carbon; Ecology; Estimates; Forestry; Models; Soil; Trees; United States; Carbon Economy; Carbon sequestration; Ecology; Forest ecology; Forestry; Laws and legislation; Organic carbon; Soils; Carbon pool; Forest carbons; Forest inventory and analysis; Forest inventory and analyze; Litter carbon; Modelling systems; National scale volume and biomass; Soil organic carbon; Tree biomass; Tree live biomass; aboveground biomass; allometry; carbon cycle; forest inventory; litter; population estimation; soil organic matter; Biomass,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010440366
